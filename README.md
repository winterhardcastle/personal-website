# personal-website

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio that conveys my broad experience in Software, Design and Making. It is build with Typescript and React, and the 3D animations are done with Three.js

I enjoy using interfaces that manage to be interesting and dymanic despite their simplicity. This website is intended to be an example of this!
