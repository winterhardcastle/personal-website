            My name is Winter Hardcastle, I am a web developer and maker with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly software solutions.

            My journey into the world of software development began with teaching myself to code Python, and since then, I have honed my skills in a variety of other programming languages and technologies, including(but not limited to)Javascript, Typescript, React, "PERN" Stack, SQL.

            As a maker, I believe that the best software solutions are those that solve real-world problems and enhance people's lives in meaningful ways. I am always on the lookout for opportunities to use my skills and creativity to build products that make a positive impact on society.

            On this website, you will find a collection of some of my best work, including web applications and other software solutions, as  well as product designs and engineering projects that I have built for clients or as personal projects. I hope that these examples will give you a sense of my style, approach, and capabilities as a developer.

            If you have a project that you would like to collaborate on or if you just want to connect with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always open to new opportunities and excited to work with other makers who share my passion for creating exceptional software.
